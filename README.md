# Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis Model (Khubaib01)

This model performs **sentiment classification on Roman Urdu text**, labeling input sentences as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**. It is fine-tuned from `xlm-roberta-base` and designed to handle **Roman Urdu, code-mixed Urdu-English, and social media style text**, including slang-heavy WhatsApp chats, YouTube comments, and Twitter posts.

## Benchmark Highlights

Khubaib01/roman-urdu-sentiment-xlm-r consistently **outperforms all existing Roman Urdu sentiment models**, particularly on **slang-heavy texts** while maintaining strong performance on formal social media datasets.

## Model Details

### Model Description
- Fine-tuned **XLM-RoBERTa Base** for Roman Urdu sentiment classification
- Trained on a **balanced, multi-domain dataset (~99k sentences)**
- Labels: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- Sources: WhatsApp chats, YouTube comments, Twitter, and other social media
- Preprocessing: Removed media-only, deleted, very short, and emoji-only messages
- Developed by: Muhammad Khubaib Ahmad
- License: MIT

### Key Advantages
- **Top-ranking model** across slang-heavy and formal datasets
- **Detects offensive/toxic content** naturally due to slang-heavy negative training data
- Balanced performance across all three sentiment classes
- Robust to multi-domain inputs, including social media and messaging platforms

## Uses

### Direct Use
- Classifying sentiment in Roman Urdu text
- Automated content moderation
- Identifying offensive, abusive, or highly negative content
- Analytics on Roman Urdu datasets, e.g., public sentiment tracking

### Downstream Use
- Feature extraction in multi-task NLP pipelines
- Adaptable for other Roman Urdu classification tasks with additional fine-tuning

### Out-of-Scope
- Native Urdu script without transliteration
- Subtle sarcasm, irony, or context-specific toxicity
- Newly coined or highly domain-specific slang not seen in training

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations
- May inherit biases from the training data (slang, offensive terms, informal language)
- Accuracy may drop on rare, new, or unseen Roman Urdu slang
- Heavy code-mixing or highly non-standard text may be misclassified
- Should not be relied on as a dedicated toxicity detection tool; flags negative/offensive content as part of sentiment

## Recommendations
- Validate predictions for critical applications
- Consider additional fine-tuning for domain-specific scenarios

## How to Get Started

### Quick Start
```python
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline(
    "text-classification",
    model="Khubaib01/roman-urdu-sentiment-xlm-r",
    truncation=True
)

pipe("ye banda bohot acha hai")

```
### Advanced Usage
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_id = "Khubaib01/roman-urdu-sentiment-xlm-r"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)

inputs = tokenizer("ye insan acha nahi lagta", return_tensors="pt")
logits = model(**inputs).logits
label_id = logits.argmax(dim=-1).item()

id2label = {0:"Positive", 1:"Negative", 2:"Neutral"}
print(id2label[label_id])
```
